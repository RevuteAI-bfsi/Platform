Banking Customer Service Training Conversation Manager
----------------------------------------------------
This module manages the simulated customer conversations for banking service training.
It handles persona management, response generation, and conversation analysis.

Key components:
1. LLM integration with both LangChain and direct Groq API implementations
2. Customer persona simulation with trait-based response generation
3. Banking product lookup from CSV data
4. Conversation analysis for bank representative feedback

    Generate a natural greeting to the bank representative that clearly shows your personality traits.

    IMPORTANT: Provide ONLY the customer's response. DO NOT include instructions, alternatives, or metadata.
    DO NOT include phrases like "Changes subject," or "circular questions" or "Sorry, what were you saying?"
    DO NOT wrap your response in quotes or add any prefixes.
    
    Examples based on different personas:
    
    [Impatient, Premium customer]: "Hello. I'm having issues with charges on my premium account. I need this resolved immediately."
    
    [Polite, New applicant]: "Namaste. I wanted to know about opening my first savings account. Could you explain the process?"
    
    [Tech-savvy, Digital user]: "Hi there! My UPI transactions are failing since yesterday. Can you check what's happening?"

DO NOT include phrases like "Changes subject," or "circular questions" or alternative response options.
